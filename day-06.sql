-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT resort_name,sum_snowfall,NTILE(4) 
  over(ORDER BY sum_snowfall) AS snowfall_quartile
FROM (SELECT sum(snowfall_inches) AS sum_snowfall, resort_name
FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
GROUP BY resort_name)
